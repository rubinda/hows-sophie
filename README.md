# How's Sophie?

A bot written in go to inform me about Sophie - my hackintosh PC running in my room. It posts tweets whether it has come online or went offline. Should help me to remotely monitor the current status, which is useful if I forget to turn her off for the night.

## Installation

`go get github.com/rubinda/hows-sophie`
